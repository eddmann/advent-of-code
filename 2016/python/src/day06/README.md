## \--- Day 6: Signals and Noise ---

Something is jamming your communications with Santa. Fortunately, your signal is only partially jammed, and protocol in situations like this is to switch to a simple [repetition code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetition_code) to get the message through.

In this model, the same message is sent repeatedly. You've recorded the repeating message signal (your puzzle input), but the data seems quite corrupted - almost too badly to recover. _Almost_.

All you need to do is figure out which character is most frequent for each position. For example, suppose you had recorded the following messages:

```
eedadn
drvtee
eandsr
raavrd
atevrs
tsrnev
sdttsa
rasrtv
nssdts
ntnada
svetve
tesnvt
vntsnd
vrdear
dvrsen
enarar
```

The most common character in the first column is `e`; in the second, `a`; in the third, `s`, and so on. Combining these characters returns the error-corrected message, `easter`.

Given the recording in your puzzle input, _what is the error-corrected version_ of the message being sent?

Your puzzle answer was `gyvwpxaz`.

## \--- Part Two ---

Of course, that _would_ be the message - if you hadn't agreed to use a _modified repetition code_ instead.

In this modified code, the sender instead transmits what looks like random data, but for each character, the character they actually want to send is _slightly less likely_ than the others. Even after signal-jamming noise, you can look at the letter distributions in each column and choose the _least common_ letter to reconstruct the original message.

In the above example, the least common character in the first column is `a`; in the second, `d`, and so on. Repeating this process for the remaining characters produces the original message, `advent`.

Given the recording in your puzzle input and this new decoding methodology, _what is the original message_ that Santa is trying to send?

Your puzzle answer was `jucfoary`.

Both parts of this puzzle are complete! They provide two gold stars: \*\*

At this point, all that is left is for you to [admire your Advent calendar](/2016).
