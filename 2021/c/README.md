# Advent of Code 2021 in C ðŸŽ„

```
$ make solve/{day}
$ make test
$ make test DAY={day}
```

For the 2021 calendar I decided to solve the Advent of Code solutions in C.
The coding style is based on [How to C in 2016](https://matt.sh/howto-c) and compiles following the C11 standard.

Each solution can be run as a standalone executable (using `make solve/{day}` and the provided `input.txt`), or as a single benchmarked executable (using `make build`).
